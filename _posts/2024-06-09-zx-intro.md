In our work towards practical Quantum 1-Shot Signatures, we have two main problems to solve:

- Building cryptographic gadgets called [equivocal hash functions](https://github.com/The-QSig-Commission/QSigCommissionWiki/wiki/Hash-function#equivocal-hash-function).
- Baking them into quantum circuits, and simplify the latter enough that the they can be run on quantum computers in the not-too-far future.

**TODO: Talk about why we need ZX**


The [ZX calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX-calculus) is a diagrammatic language which can be used to design and reason about quantum circuits, originally devised by [Coecke and Duncan](https://arxiv.org/abs/0906.4725). A cool observation about it is that the very same rewrite rules which are used to reason about quantum circuits can also be leveraged to simplify them, performing the same computation while optimising some cost function of interest. For example, ZX-based techniques are State-of-the-Art for [T-count reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10477) &mdash; useful in a future fault-tolerant quantum computation regime &mdash; and [2-qubit gate count reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02793) &mdash; useful for both the future fault-tolerant regime and the noisy near-term regime.

The ZX calculus is limited to qubit-based digital quantum computing, but several extension exist which cover a broad spectrum of quantum computing paradigms. The [ZH calculus](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.02175), for example, has notations and rewrite rules specialised for quantum computations making heavy use of binary logic gates, such as those appearing in our work. An extension of the ZH calculus from binary to [modular arithmetic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10095) already exists, and an extension to arbitrary finite fields is upcoming; we expect both will be highly relevant to our work in the near future. Many other calculi exist, such as ones to reason about [photonic quantum computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02114),  or [continuous-variable quantum computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02905), and a searchable database of the literature can be found on the [ZX calculus website](https://zxcalculus.com/).

## Building Blocks

**TODO: I will change narrative from Z spiders + X spiders as generators to Z spiders + H box as generators, so that a later generalisation to ZH becomes more natural.**

In the ZX calculus, quantum circuits are represented as networks of low-level building blocks known as 'spiders'. Spiders come in two 'colours', for the Z basis and the X basis respectively, and are shown below alongside the traditional [bra-ket notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bra%E2%80%93ket_notation) for the linear maps which they represent.

Spiders can be annotated by an angle, known as their 'phase'; when omitted, it is 0 by convention. A spiders can have any number $m \geq 0$ of input legs and any number $n \geq 0$ of output legs, and it represents a linear map from $m$ qubits to $n$ qubits. We now discuss some special cases of immediate interest in quantum computing. The 1-to-1 spiders are single-qubit rotations, about the Z and X axis, respectively:

==Figure: Z (resp. X) rotation==

The 0-to-1 spiders represent the single-qubit states &mdash; column vectors, or 'kets' &mdash; along the Z-axis equator of the Bloch sphere and its X-axis equator, respectively:

== Figure: Z (resp. X) spider states==

The 1-to-0 spiders are the 'adjoints' the states above &mdash; row vectors, or 'bras' &mdash;, and are used to represent the outcomes of certain single-qubit measurements:

== Figure: Z (resp. X) spider effects==

Even though the [Hadamard gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate#Hadamard_gate) can ultimately be defined in terms of spiders, as shown below, its usage in qubit-based quantum computing is so common that a special notation is available for it in the ZX calculus:

== Figure: the Euler definition of the H gate==

Spiders with $m$ input legs and $m$ output legs can be represented as $2^n$-by-$2^m$ complex matrices, composed in sequence by [matrix multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication) and in parallel by [Kronecker product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronecker_product). However, a more flexible semantics for spiders is as [tensors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor) in a [tensor network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_network), where each connection between spiders corresponds to a [tensor contraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_contraction). This shift of perspective is at the heart of recent breakthroughs in quantum simulation: for those interested in this topic, we recommend giving a look at the techniques by [Gray and Kourtis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01935), implemented in the [cotengra](https://github.com/jcmgray/cotengra) library, or the work on the [Jet](https://github.com/XanaduAI/jet) library by [researchers at Xanadu](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2022-05-09-709/).

We will henceforth adopt the interpretation of spiders as tensors, rather than complex matrices, to exploit the additional flexibility of graph-theoretic contraction semantics for tensor networks over the parallel-and-sequential composition semantics of complex matrices. We will use 'diagram' to indicate a network of spiders &mdash; a two-coloured graph, with optional angle annotations on nodes and optional Hadamard boxes on some edges &mdash; and reserve the 'tensor network' nomenclature to their concrete numerical interpretation (as one would use in [cotengra](https://github.com/jcmgray/cotengra) or [Jet](https://github.com/XanaduAI/jet)).

For the ZX calculus to be useful in digital quantum computing, it has to be able to represent all matrices/tensors between qubits: this property is known as 'universality' of the calculus.
To show universality, it is enough (cf. Section 4.5 of [Nielsen and Chuang](https://archive.org/details/QuantumComputationAndQuantumInformation10thAnniversaryEdition/)) to show that we can represent (i) arbitrary single-qubit rotations and (ii) the 2-qubit CNOT gate. Single-qubit rotations can always be obtained as a sequence of three alternating Z-X-Z rotations, for suitable choice of angles: we already introduced these above, as 1-to-1 spiders. For the CNOT gate, on the other hand, we need two more instances of spiders: the 1-to-2 copy spider and the 2-to-1 XOR spider, shown below.

==Figure: the copy and XOR spiders==

Combined, the copy and XOR spiders form the CNOT gate, the most common 2-qubit gate used in digital quantum computing:

### Rewrite Rules

Above, we have shown that the ZX calculus is 'universal': it can represent all tensors between qubits, and hence all computations in digital quantum computing. This makes it useful to write down quantum circuits, but not yet to reason about them. To gain reasoning powers, we need to introduce 'rewrite rules': these are equations relating some small distinct diagrams which correspond to the same fragment of computation, i.e. ones whose corresponding tensor networks contract to the same overall tensor.
There are several broadly equivalent presentations for the rules of the ZX calculus: here, we will follow the presentations from Section 3.2 of [Miriam Backens's PhD Thesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.08954) and Section 2.2 of [Harny Wang's PhD Thesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14894).
